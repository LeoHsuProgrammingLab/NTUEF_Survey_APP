# NTUEF_Survey_APP
The forest plots survey app for National Taiwan University Experimental Forest (NTUEF).
I am a graduate student majoring in Forestry and Environmental Resource Conservation Department. I collaborated with NTUEF to build a tablet application for forest surveys, improving the efficiency of data processing and the accuracy of surveys.

## Objectives
1. Getting rid of the daunting work of keying data to Excel.
2. Assure the quality of surveys by preventing large deviations between surveys.  

## Novel Functions
1. New-plot Survey: Recording new data.
2. Old-plot Survey: Providing validity check for tree attributes compared to the last survey.
3. Output a JSON file and write to the remote database.
